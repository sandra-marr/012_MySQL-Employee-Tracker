## Description 
This application allows users to manage thier employees, departments and roles and acts as a content management system through the command line. While the functioanlity of this could be done in mySQL, it seemed like an application in the command line would be more user friendly and accessible to a broader audience. 
This application helps the user to manager employees by completing simple tasks such as viewing all employees, roles, or departments. It also heelps with more complex tasks such as changing an employee role or manager, adding or removing employees, roles, departments, or even viewing a departments operating budget. 

## Lessons Learned
In building this application I learned a lot about the interaction with mySQL and javascript. Both getting data from and sending data to the database will be critical moving forward in learning about web development. While the methods used in this application are not all inclusive, it was a great stepping stone to learn how data is passed along. I also get a lot more experience using inquirer. 

## Installation
To use this application, clone the git repository. Then run an "npm i" in the terminal to install the relevant dependencies. 

## Usage
To use this application, you will need to create the database in mySQL Workbench. Copy all in the employee_seeds.sql file, paste it into mySQL Workbench, and run the code. Once the database is set, run "npm start" in the terminal to use the application.
